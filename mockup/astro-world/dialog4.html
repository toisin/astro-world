    Great! Now, let's figure out whether those factors actually matter!<br>
    What I have in my database is a list of records of how the applicants performed.<br>
    If you study the records carefully, you will be able to see which factors make a difference to performance and which don’t.<br>
    Now, let's try it.<br>
    On the screen, look for an applicant who you want to look at by selecting a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant who is like that and tell you his/her performance<br>
    Remember to click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    <br>
    As you can see, you selected Record #3, Paul Roy. And you can see that his performance was C.<br>
    <br>
    Now that you know how to select a record, why don't you start figuring out whether Fitness matter by choosing one or two cases.
    How many records would you like to see? One or Two?<br>
